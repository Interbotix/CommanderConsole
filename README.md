CommanderConsole
================

Arduino (168/328) firmware for Commander Console.

Code to run ON the Commander Console (yet to be released). It is a table-top panel version of the Arbotix Commander, supporting additional analog inputs. All code based on original Commander firmware. This is installed on an Arduino Uno/Duem/Diec 168/328 model Arduino compatible microcontroller and reads inputs, sending the data over a modified Commander protocol to the Arbtoix. 

The library for the Arbotix to decode CommanderConsole packets is also titled "CommanderConsole", and is found in the Trossen Robotics arbotix development fork:
